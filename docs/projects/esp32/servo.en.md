# Servo

A servo is a small geared motor that stops at a precise angle — exactly what you need for a robot arm, the steering of a small RC car, or a self-opening lid. Here we drive it from the ESP32 in MicroPython, through PWM at 50 Hz.

## Description

A hobby servo (SG90, MG90, SG5010) expects a **short pulse repeated every 20 ms** on the signal wire. The pulse width sets the angle:

- ~0.5 ms → 0°
- ~1.5 ms → 90° (center)
- ~2.4 ms → 180°

There's no built-in `Servo` library on the ESP32 the way there is on Arduino — we use `machine.PWM` directly at 50 Hz and compute the `duty` from the angle. At 10-bit resolution (0–1023), a 1 ms pulse is `duty ≈ 51` and a 2 ms pulse is `duty ≈ 102`.

## Components

| Component | Quantity |
|-----------|----------|
| ESP32 board (DevKit V1) | 1 |
| SG90 servo (9 g) | 1 |
| M-M jumper wires | 3 |
| External 5 V supply (recommended for 2+ servos) | as needed |

### SG90 specs

- Operating voltage: 4.8 – 6 V
- Torque: ~1.6 kg·cm at 4.8 V
- Speed: ~0.12 s / 60°

## Wiring

| Servo wire | Color | ESP32 |
|------------|-------|-------|
| GND (−) | brown / black | GND |
| V+ | red | Vin / 5V (see note) |
| Signal | orange / yellow | GPIO 13 |

```board
    ESP32                Servo SG90
   GPIO 13 ──── orange ── Signal
     5V / Vin ── red    ── Power (+)
     GND ────── brown  ── Ground (−)
```

!!! warning "Powering the servo"
    SG90 wants **5 V**. The ESP32 `3.3V` pin is not enough — torque sags during motion and the board can reset from current spikes. Use the **Vin** pin (= 5 V when the board is powered over USB) for a single servo, or an external 5 V supply with a common ground for 2+ servos. **Never power a servo from 3.3 V.**

## Code

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time

# --- Setup ---

SERVO_PIN = 13
FREQ = 50          # 50 Hz = 20 ms period (what the servo expects)

# Duty for SG90 at 10-bit resolution:
#   0°   → 0.5 ms pulse  → duty ≈ 26
#   90°  → 1.5 ms pulse  → duty ≈ 77
#   180° → 2.4 ms pulse  → duty ≈ 123
DUTY_MIN = 26
DUTY_MAX = 123

servo = PWM(Pin(SERVO_PIN), freq=FREQ, duty=0)


def set_angle(angle):
    """Set the servo angle between 0 and 180 degrees."""
    angle = max(0, min(180, angle))                    # clamp
    duty = DUTY_MIN + (DUTY_MAX - DUTY_MIN) * angle // 180
    servo.duty(duty)


def sweep():
    """Slow sweep 0° → 180° → 0°."""
    for a in range(0, 181, 2):
        set_angle(a)
        time.sleep_ms(15)
    for a in range(180, -1, -2):
        set_angle(a)
        time.sleep_ms(15)


try:
    while True:
        sweep()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    set_angle(90)        # park at center
    time.sleep_ms(500)
    servo.deinit()
```

## Run the script

1. Plug the ESP32 into USB.
2. In Thonny, paste the code and save it as `main.py` on the **MicroPython device**.
3. Press **Run** (F5). The servo shaft should slowly sweep from 0° to 180° and back.

If the servo jerks and then dies, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Calibration

Cheap servos vary between units — your SG90's real travel may be 5°…175° rather than 0°…180°. If at `angle=0` you hear a buzz (the shaft is jammed against a mechanical stop), bump `DUTY_MIN` up by 2-3 counts. If `angle=180` doesn't reach the end, raise `DUTY_MAX`.

```python
# Test the ends before using sweep()
set_angle(0)     # should glide cleanly to the left
time.sleep(1)
set_angle(180)   # then to the right
```

## Example: angle from the REPL

Send an angle from Thonny's REPL and the servo goes straight there:

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM

servo = PWM(Pin(13), freq=50)
DUTY_MIN, DUTY_MAX = 26, 123

def set_angle(a):
    a = max(0, min(180, a))
    servo.duty(DUTY_MIN + (DUTY_MAX - DUTY_MIN) * a // 180)

# In the REPL: set_angle(45), set_angle(120), etc.
```

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Servo jitters without being commanded"
    - Current spikes. Make sure you power from **Vin / 5V**, not 3.3V.
    - Add a **100 µF capacitor** between V+ and GND, close to the servo.
    - For 2+ servos, use an external 5 V supply and tie its ground to the ESP32 ground.

??? question "The ESP32 resets when the servo starts moving"
    - The servo's inrush current sags the rail below the reset threshold. Use external power, not USB.

??? question "The shaft slams a mechanical stop (audible buzz)"
    - You're commanding an angle outside the real range. See [Calibration](#calibration) — tighten `DUTY_MIN` / `DUTY_MAX`.

??? question "The servo moves the opposite way of what I expect"
    - Flip the mapping: replace `angle` with `180 - angle` inside `set_angle()`.

??? question "`OSError: invalid pin` on `PWM(Pin(...))`"
    - The pin can't do PWM (e.g. GPIO 34–39 are input-only). Move the signal to GPIO **13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33**.

## Extension ideas

- **Joystick → servo:** read a pot on GPIO 34 (ADC1) and map 0–4095 to 0–180°. See [Robot Car Remote](robot_car_remote.md) for a full example of joystick-on-ADC.
- **Pan/tilt with two servos:** one horizontal, one vertical, mounted on a small bracket — the basis for a camera that tracks an object.
- **Robot status indicator:** combine with the [RGB LED](rgb_led.md) to signal state (green = idle, red = moving).
- **Wireless control:** send the angle over [ESP-NOW](esp_now.md) from a remote — no cables, no Wi-Fi.

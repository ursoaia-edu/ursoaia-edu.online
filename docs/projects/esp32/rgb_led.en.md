# RGB LED

An **RGB LED** packs three LEDs (red, green, blue) in a single body. On the ESP32 we drive each channel with **PWM** and can produce nearly any color in the visible spectrum. The code runs in MicroPython.

![RGB LED with ESP32 — multicolor on a breadboard](../../assets/images/projects/esp32/preview-rgb-led.jpg)

## Description

The ESP32 has a built-in LED PWM controller that gives you **up to 16 independent channels**. For an RGB LED we use 3 — one per color. Sweeping the duty cycle between 0 and 1023 produces a continuous brightness perception, exactly like `analogWrite` on Arduino, except here the default resolution is 10-bit (0–1023) instead of 8-bit (0–255).

## Components

| Component | Quantity |
|-----------|----------|
| ESP32 board (DevKit V1 or similar) | 1 |
| RGB LED (common cathode) | 1 |
| 220 Ω resistor | 3 |
| Breadboard | 1 |
| M-M jumper wires | 4 |

## How it works

An RGB LED has **4 legs**:

- 3 anodes (+): red, green, blue — one per color.
- 1 common cathode (−) — the longest leg, goes to GND.

Each anode needs its **own 220 Ω resistor** to limit current.

### PWM on the ESP32

Unlike Arduino UNO (where only pins marked `~` can do PWM), on the ESP32 **almost any GPIO** can be a PWM pin — the internal controller assigns a hardware channel automatically. In MicroPython:

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
ch = PWM(Pin(25), freq=1000, duty=512)   # 50% brightness
ch.duty(0)      # off
ch.duty(1023)   # max
```

Common `(R, G, B)` combos (at 1023 resolution):

- `(1023, 0, 0)` → pure red
- `(0, 1023, 0)` → pure green
- `(1023, 1023, 0)` → yellow
- `(1023, 1023, 1023)` → white
- `(512, 0, 1023)` → purple

## Wiring

We use **GPIO 25, 26, 27** — free on any DevKit V1 and PWM-capable with no conflicts.

| RGB LED pin | ESP32 |
|-------------|-------|
| R (red)     | GPIO 25 (through 220 Ω) |
| G (green)   | GPIO 26 (through 220 Ω) |
| B (blue)    | GPIO 27 (through 220 Ω) |
| Common cathode (−) | GND |

```board
    ESP32             RGB LED (common cathode)
   GPIO 25 ──[220Ω]──── R
   GPIO 26 ──[220Ω]──── G
   GPIO 27 ──[220Ω]──── B
      GND ─────────── Cathode (−, longest leg)
```

!!! warning "Pins to avoid"
    GPIO **6–11** are wired to the internal SPI flash — never connect anything there. GPIO **34–39** are input-only, no PWM. GPIO 0, 2, 12, 15 have boot-strap roles — they can work but may block boot if the LED pulls too much current.

## Code

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time

# --- Setup ---

# PWM pins for the three RGB channels
red   = PWM(Pin(25), freq=1000, duty=0)
green = PWM(Pin(26), freq=1000, duty=0)
blue  = PWM(Pin(27), freq=1000, duty=0)

DELAY_MS = 10  # fade speed


def set_color(r, g, b):
    """Set the LED color. Values 0-1023."""
    red.duty(r)
    green.duty(g)
    blue.duty(b)


def fade(from_color, to_color, steps=255, delay_ms=DELAY_MS):
    """Smooth transition between two colors (R, G, B tuples)."""
    fr, fg, fb = from_color
    tr, tg, tb = to_color
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        r = fr + (tr - fr) * i // steps
        g = fg + (tg - fg) * i // steps
        b = fb + (tb - fb) * i // steps
        set_color(r, g, b)
        time.sleep_ms(delay_ms)


RED   = (1023, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 1023, 0)
BLUE  = (0, 0, 1023)
OFF   = (0, 0, 0)

try:
    while True:
        fade(RED, GREEN)
        fade(GREEN, BLUE)
        fade(BLUE, RED)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # On stop, turn the LED off so it doesn't stay lit
    set_color(0, 0, 0)
    red.deinit()
    green.deinit()
    blue.deinit()
```

## Run the script

1. Plug the ESP32 into USB and open Thonny.
2. Paste the code above and save it as `main.py` on the **MicroPython device** (so it runs automatically on every boot).
3. Press **Run** (F5). The LED should slowly cycle through red → green → blue → red, each transition taking ~2.5 seconds.

If the LED doesn't react, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Example: single fixed color

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM

red   = PWM(Pin(25), freq=1000)
green = PWM(Pin(26), freq=1000)
blue  = PWM(Pin(27), freq=1000)

# Pale purple (R=200, G=0, B=512)
red.duty(200)
green.duty(0)
blue.duty(512)
```

## Example: random color every second

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
import random
import time

channels = [PWM(Pin(p), freq=1000) for p in (25, 26, 27)]

while True:
    for ch in channels:
        ch.duty(random.randint(0, 1023))
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Troubleshooting

??? question "LED doesn't light up at all"
    - Check the **common cathode** — the longest leg must go to GND.
    - Confirm a **220 Ω resistor on each anode** — without them the LED can burn out or, on marginal power, never light up.
    - Try another USB cable — some "power only" cables don't deliver enough current.

??? question "One color is much brighter than the others"
    - That's normal — red LEDs run at ~1.8 V while green/blue need 3.0–3.2 V; at the same resistor value, red appears brighter. Compensate in software: `red.duty(int(value * 0.6))`.

??? question "I bought a common-anode LED"
    - Flip the logic: `0` means full on, `1023` means off. Replace `set_color`:
      ```python
      def set_color(r, g, b):
          red.duty(1023 - r)
          green.duty(1023 - g)
          blue.duty(1023 - b)
      ```
    - Wire the longest leg to **3.3 V** instead of GND.

??? question "`OSError: invalid pin` on `PWM(Pin(...))`"
    - The chosen pin doesn't support PWM (e.g. GPIO 34–39 are input-only). Pick other pins — recommended: 25, 26, 27, 32, 33.

## Extension ideas

- **Button to switch modes:** a button on GPIO 32 cycles between "solid", "RGB fade", "random".
- **Potentiometer control:** three pots on ADC1 (GPIO 36, 39, 34) drive each channel manually.
- **DHT22 mood light:** color reflects the temperature (blue < 20 °C, green 20–25 °C, red > 25 °C) — combine with the [DHT22 project](temperature.md).
- **Wireless sync:** send the color value with [ESP-NOW](esp_now.md) — one master board drives many RGB LEDs at the same time.
